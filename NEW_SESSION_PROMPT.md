**Prompt:**

```
I'm continuing work on the aws-multi-account-bootstrap project. We were about to run an end-to-end test of the v1.0 MVP before building v1.1 features.

Current status:
- v1.2.0 was just released
- All v1.0 features are implemented
- CI/CD pipeline is working (tested with CDK synth)
- We need to run a full E2E test with real AWS accounts

Please read E2E_TEST_PLAN.md and help me execute the test plan step by step.

Context from previous session:
- We're on Windows
- AWS CLI is installed (v2.13.7)
- The MVP code is complete but hasn't been tested end-to-end yet
- After successful E2E test, we'll start building v1.1 features (see ROADMAP.md)

Let's start with Phase 1: Prerequisites Verification from the E2E test plan.
```

---

## Alternative Shorter Prompt:

```
Continue E2E testing for aws-multi-account-bootstrap. Read E2E_TEST_PLAN.md and let's start testing the MVP end-to-end. We're on Phase 1: Prerequisites Verification.
```

## üéØ What We're Testing:

Testing the complete workflow:
1. Create 3 AWS accounts (dev/staging/prod)
2. Bootstrap CDK in all accounts
3. Create GitHub repository with CI/CD
4. Set up billing alerts
5. Deploy a test stack
6. Verify semantic release works

## Expected Outcome:

- ‚úÖ All tests pass ‚Üí Mark v1.0 production-ready, start v1.1
- ‚ùå Tests fail ‚Üí Document issues, fix them, retest
