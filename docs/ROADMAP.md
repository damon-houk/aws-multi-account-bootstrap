## 💡 Philosophy & Principles

### Design Principles (Unchanging)

1. **Simplicity First** - The 80% use case should be trivial
2. **Opinionated Defaults** - But flexible when needed
3. **One Command** - Setup complexity hidden behind simple interface
4. **Cost Conscious** - Billing alerts and optimization by default
5. **Security by Default** - OIDC, least privilege, audit logging
6. **Documentation Matters** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
7. **Open & Welcoming** - Contributions celebrated, questions welcomed

### What We Won't Build

- ❌ Support for outdated AWS services
- ❌ Overly complex UIs (keep it CLI-first)
- ❌ Features that violate security best practices
- ❌ Anything that requires compromising simplicity for edge cases
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (keep migration paths open)

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Why not just use AWS Control Tower?**
A: Control Tower is great for enterprises but overkill (and expensive) for small teams. We target the 80% use case.

**Q: Will you support Terraform instead of CDK?**
A: Yes! Terraform bootstrap option planned for v1.2.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: v1.0 is production-ready for the features it includes. v1.2+ will add more production-grade features.

**Q: What if I need more than 3 accounts now?**
A: You can manually add accounts and run individual scripts. v1.1 will have templates.

**Q: Will this always be free?**
A: The core tool will always be open-source. We may offer managed services or enterprise support in the future.
